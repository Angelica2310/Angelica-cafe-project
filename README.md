# Angelica-cafe-project
The first project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I learned the skills from YouTube and Udemy.

## Features
- The app features a dynamic navigation bar that links to specific sections of the page when clicked.
- The booking button is a fixed element that remains visible and accessible as the user scrolls through the page.
- A "Scroll Up" button allows users to quickly navigate back to the top of the page.
- The dynamic menu is organized into categories by section: Breakfast, Coffee, and Desserts.
- The page also includes a well-designed "Contact Us" section, featuring clear contact information, an embedded map, and a contact form.
### Future consideration
- The booking system is fully functional, allowing users to reserve a space conveniently.
- Users can utilize the contact form to get in touch with the caf√© for inquiries or feedback.
- Additional UI enhancements have been made to improve the visual appeal and overall user experience of the page.
- A dedicated section displays all user feedback, showcasing comments and reviews to highlight customer experiences.
